First step is to install it in this way :
<br/>
  &emsp;<b>npm install try-text</b>
<br/>
<br/>
Second step is to import it inside your code :
<br/>
   &emsp;<b>import TryText from "try-text/build/index";</b>
<br/>
<br/>
Than the last step is to use it with 3 required attributes :
<br/>
  &emsp;<b>< TryText title={title} color={color} text={text} /></b>
